### To make git commits according to an issue being worked
Make sure that you are on a feature branch. If not, do

`git checkout -b branch-name`

Commit message should follow this format.

`git commit -m '[verb in present tense] [item being worked]' -m '#[issue number]'`

For example: `git commit -m 'create user login component' -m '#3'`

Push to this repository.

For first commit on branch: `git push -u origin branch-name`

For subsequent commits on branch: `git push`

### Important Note
Please make sure to `git pull` before working on anything at the start of the day.
